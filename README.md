# ChatGroup

Using Java and SpingBoot and MongoDB, I created a chat app. The app allows several users to connect to the same chat and talk to each other.
Based on a distributed system of nodes, the docker is responsible for ensuring that the various nodes are connected.
The application allows users to register and authenticate before entering the chat room.
Once authenticated, users can communicate with each other.
The ChatGroup-Video.zip file contains a video in which I present the app.
